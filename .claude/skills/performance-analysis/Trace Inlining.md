### Key options explained in detail

The `--engine.TraceInlining` option enables tracing of language-agnostic inlining decisions during Truffle compilation. Unlike legacy AST-based inlining, this modern approach (introduced in GraalVM 20.2.0) performs partial evaluation on call candidates before making inlining decisions, using actual Graal IR node count as the size metric. This produces more accurate decisions but increases average compilation time by approximately 10%.

The `--engine.TraceInliningDetails` flag expands tracing to show the entire explored call tree, not just final inlining decisions. This reveals which methods were considered but rejected for inlining and why. The output volume increases substantially, making it suitable for deep analysis of specific compilations rather than routine use.

The two budget parameters control inlining aggressiveness through distinct mechanisms. **InliningExpansionBudget** (default 12,000 Graal nodes) limits how much partial evaluation the compiler performs to explore inlining candidates. When this budget exhausts, remaining candidates receive "Cutoff" status without evaluation. **InliningInliningBudget** (default 12,000 Graal nodes) limits the total size of the compilation unit after inlining. Methods that would exceed this budget are marked "Expanded" but not inlined. These budgets prevent compilation units from growing pathologically large, which would cause excessive compilation time or compiler failures.

### Advanced options for expert users

The `--engine.InliningRecursionDepth` parameter (default 2) controls how deeply recursive calls can be inlined. Recursive inlining unrolls recursive functions to a specified depth, allowing optimization of recursive algorithms. Higher values enable more loop unrolling but risk code explosion. Setting to 0 disables recursive inlining entirely.

Completely disabling inlining via `--engine.Inlining=false` serves as a diagnostic tool to measure inlining's performance impact. Comparing execution with and without inlining quantifies the benefit. Note that disabling inlining dramatically reduces performance—typically by 2-10x—because call overhead remains and cross-function optimizations cannot occur.

For focused debugging, combine `--engine.CompileOnly=functionName` with TraceInlining to isolate specific methods. This drastically reduces output volume when investigating why a particular function isn't inlining its callees as expected.

## 3. Functional Description
### Primary Purpose

In Truffle, inlining occurs during **partial evaluation**—the first phase of JIT compilation where the Truffle Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) transforms into Graal intermediate representation (IR). Understanding this tool requires grasping what makes Truffle's inlining unique compared to traditional JIT compilers. Traditional compilers inline method calls after generating IR, making decisions based on method bytecode size and heuristics. Truffle performs inlining during partial evaluation itself, making decisions based on the actual IR that results from specializing the interpreter for specific guest code patterns.

The **primary purpose** of `--engine.TraceInlining` is tracing these language-agnostic inlining decisions. Every time Truffle compiles a guest language function, it builds an internal call tree representing all potential callees reachable from the root. For each call in this tree, the tool must decide: inline this call into the parent compilation unit, or leave it as a call boundary? The trace output documents every such decision with detailed rationale: how large is the callee's IR, how does inlining affect call counts, was the decision forced by annotations, did budget exhaustion prevent exploration?
### What the Tool Does

The **technical mechanism** proceeds through several phases. First, during **call tree construction**, the engine analyzes the root function's AST, identifying all direct calls to other Truffle functions. Each call becomes a node in the call tree. Second, **partial evaluation before decisions** distinguishes this approach: the compiler partially evaluates each candidate call target to determine its actual compiled size in Graal nodes, not AST nodes. This is crucial because AST size poorly predicts compiled code size—specialization and constant folding can collapse large ASTs into tiny IR, while some small ASTs expand into complex control flow. Third, **budget-based decision making** uses two budgets to control the process. The exploration budget limits how many candidates to partially evaluate, while the inlining budget limits total compilation unit size .

### How it Works

Each call in the tree transitions through one of six **call states** that appear in the output. **Inlined** means the call was successfully incorporated into the parent compilation unit—the callee's IR is directly embedded, eliminating call overhead and enabling cross-function optimization. **Cutoff** indicates the exploration budget exhausted before evaluating this candidate; it wasn't analyzed at all, so its size is unknown (shown as 0 IR nodes). **Expanded** means the call was partially evaluated but deemed too expensive to inline—either its IR size is excessive, or the inlining budget would be exceeded. **Removed** is the best outcome: partial evaluation proved the call can be completely eliminated through optimization (e.g., a getter that just returns a constant field). **Indirect** indicates an indirect call (through a variable or callback) that cannot be inlined without speculative optimization. **BailedOut** is rare and concerning—partial evaluation failed for this target, usually indicating a fundamental issue in the language implementation that prevents compilation.
### When to Use

Language developers need inlining visibility because **inlining decisions directly determine peak performance**. Call overhead is expensive in modern CPUs—typically 5-20 nanoseconds per call due to branch misprediction and pipeline stalls. For tight inner loops calling functions thousands of times per millisecond, this overhead dominates. Beyond eliminating call overhead, inlining enables crucial cross-function optimizations: constant propagation across call boundaries, dead code elimination of unused parameters, and specialization of callees based on caller context. When critical functions fail to inline due to size limits or budget exhaustion, performance suffers significantly—often 2-5x slower for computation-intensive code.

The tool serves multiple **use cases during development phases**. During **performance debugging**, when profiling reveals unexpectedly poor performance despite compilation, TraceInlining shows whether hot path functions are actually inlining their callees or leaving expensive call boundaries. During **language implementation tuning**, developers adjust code structure to achieve better inlining—breaking large functions into smaller pieces, moving cold paths behind boundaries, or restructuring recursion patterns. During **benchmarking**, the tool validates that performance-critical code paths inline as expected, ensuring benchmark results reflect real optimization rather than artificial patterns. For **regression testing**, comparing inlining traces across versions detects unintended changes in inlining behavior that might degrade performance. For **teaching and learning**, the detailed traces help developers understand Truffle's compilation model and how their language implementation decisions affect optimization.

### Output interpretation guidelines

**Successful inlining pattern:**
```
[engine] Inlined FunctionName |call diff -5.00 |... |IR Nodes 2500 |...
```
Negative call diff indicates net call elimination—inlining this function removed more calls than it added (by eliminating the call itself and potentially enabling optimization of nested calls). Reasonable IR node count under budget (default 12,000) means no risk of compilation unit explosion.

**Budget exhaustion pattern:**
```
[engine] Cutoff FunctionName |... |IR Nodes 0 |...
```
Zero IR nodes signifies the function wasn't partially evaluated due to exploration budget exhaustion. If this function represents a hot path, consider increasing `--engine.InliningExpansionBudget`. However, cutoff is normal and acceptable for cold paths.

**Too expensive pattern:**
```
[engine] Expanded FunctionName |call diff 1.50 |... |IR Nodes 8500 |...
```
Positive call diff combined with expanded state means inlining this function would increase net call overhead (perhaps it contains many calls to other functions that wouldn't inline). The compiler evaluated it but decided against inlining. This may be correct—inlining isn't always beneficial if it prevents better inlining opportunities elsewhere.

**Optimal elimination pattern:**
```
[engine] Removed FunctionName |call diff -1.00 |... |IR Nodes 0 |...
```
The call was completely optimized away during partial evaluation. This is the best possible outcome—no call overhead, no code size increase. Typically occurs with simple getters, constant functions, or calls that constant folding can eliminate.

## 5. Insights & Analysis
### When should you use it?

Language developers should use TraceInlining when investigating why performance doesn't meet expectations despite successful compilation, when debugging compilation failures related to code size, when tuning inlining budgets for optimal performance, or when validating that critical hot paths are being optimized as expected. The tool answers fundamental questions: "Why isn't this function inlining its callees?" and "Is my compilation unit too large?" and "Which calls are consuming my inlining budget?"

### Actionable Insights
#### Insight: Identifying budget exhaustion bottlenecks

**Performance Issue**: Critical functions reaching Cutoff state  
**Symptom in Output**: Important hot path functions showing state "Cutoff" with 0 IR nodes, particularly when appearing early in the call tree traversal. The exploration budget exhausts before evaluating these candidates.

**Root Cause**: The exploration budget (default 12,000 Graal nodes) controls how much partial evaluation work the compiler performs to explore candidates. Complex compilation units with many potential callees can exhaust this budget, leaving later candidates unexplored. The compiler prioritizes candidates in heuristic order—typically by call frequency and inline annotations—so cutoff usually affects less important calls. However, if heuristics misjudge importance or the root function is exceptionally complex, critical calls may hit cutoff.

**Resolution**: Incrementally increase the exploration budget using `--engine.InliningExpansionBudget=18000` (50% increase) and observe whether cutoff moves to less critical functions. Avoid increasing arbitrarily—excessive budgets cause compilation time explosion and potential compiler failures. Profile using `--cpusampler` to confirm cutoff functions are actually hot before tuning budgets. Alternatively, refactor code structure: split large functions into smaller pieces, reduce call fan-out, or use `@TruffleBoundary` to mark cold paths that shouldn't consume budget.

**Verification Tools**: Use `--engine.TraceCompilation` to monitor compilation time increases from budget changes. Use `--engine.CompilationStatistics` to see aggregate metrics on inlining budget consumption. Verify performance improvements with actual benchmarks—budget tuning should be data-driven, not speculative.

#### Insight: Diagnosing Expanded calls blocking optimization

**Performance Issue**: Large functions preventing inlining  
**Symptom in Output**: Hot path functions marked "Expanded" with high IR node counts (approaching or exceeding 12,000), often with positive call diff values. These functions were evaluated but not inlined.

**Root Cause**: The function's compiled size exceeds available inlining budget, or inlining it would increase net call overhead because it contains many calls that wouldn't themselves inline. Large functions emerge from several patterns: directly large implementations (many operations), high specialization diversity (DSL generates many specialization combinations), or deep call chains that partially evaluate into complex control flow. Positive call diff occurs when the function body contains more calls than inlining would eliminate.

**Resolution**: The most effective solution is architectural—refactor large functions into smaller, more focused pieces. Identify cold paths (error handling, debugging, rare features) and isolate them behind `@TruffleBoundary` annotations to prevent their partial evaluation from consuming budget. Consider whether specialization is too granular—sometimes fewer, more general specializations produce smaller code. For functions that must remain large, evaluate whether forced inlining (`@TruffleBoundary(allowInlining = true)`) is appropriate, but use cautiously as this can cause compilation failures. In some cases, accepting the Expanded state is correct—not every function should inline if it prevents better optimization of smaller, hotter calls.
#### Insight: Recognizing BailedOut compilation failures

**Performance Issue**: Partial evaluation failures  
**Symptom in Output**: BailedOut state appearing for any function, which is rare and indicates serious problems. The function cannot be compiled at all.

**Root Cause**: Partial evaluation encountered conditions preventing compilation: unbounded loops without compilation-final loop counts, recursive structures without termination guarantees, excessive complexity exceeding compiler limits, or implementation patterns incompatible with partial evaluation assumptions. This represents a fundamental defect in the language implementation preventing optimization of affected code.

**Resolution**: BailedOut requires immediate investigation as it indicates broken optimization. Enable detailed compiler logging with `--vm.Djdk.graal.Log=:3` and `--vm.Djdk.graal.MethodFilter=BailedOutMethod` to capture bailout reasons. Use IGV to examine where partial evaluation fails. Common fixes include marking problematic loops with `@TruffleBoundary`, restructuring recursion to enable inlining limits, simplifying control flow, or using `@ExplodeLoop` with appropriate `@CompilationFinal` annotations for bounded loops. Contact the Truffle development team if bailout reasons seem unreasonable—occasional compiler bugs do occur.

**Verification Tools**: Use `--engine.CompilationStatistics` with `--engine.CompilationStatisticsDetails` to see bailout counts and categories. Use `--engine.TracePerformanceWarnings=all` to check for related warnings that might explain the bailout.
#### Insight: Optimizing recursive function inlining

**Performance Issue**: Recursive calls not unrolling  
**Symptom in Output**: Recursive functions showing Recursion Depth > 0 but many recursive calls remaining as Invoke nodes rather than inlining.

**Root Cause**: The recursion depth limit (default 2) prevents deeper inlining of recursive calls. This protects against code explosion but limits optimization of recursive algorithms. Some recursive patterns benefit from deeper unrolling—tail recursion, simple recursive arithmetic, or tree traversals with predictable depth.

**Resolution**: Increase `--engine.InliningRecursionDepth=4` cautiously and measure impact. Higher values can dramatically improve performance for recursive code but risk compilation unit explosion. Consider refactoring recursive algorithms into iterative equivalents if possible, as loops optimize more reliably than recursion in Truffle. For must-be-recursive code, ensure the recursion terminates predictably and uses compilation-final constants for depth limits where possible.

**Verification Tools**: Use `--engine.TraceCompilation` to monitor compilation unit sizes as recursion depth increases. Use IGV to visualize unrolled recursive calls and verify the resulting IR is reasonable.

### Correlation with complementary tools

TraceInlining achieves maximum value when combined with other analysis tools. **With --engine.TraceCompilation**, you see both macro and micro perspectives: TraceCompilation shows overall compilation success, tier, timing, and total IR size, while TraceInlining shows the detailed inlining decisions that produced that result. The "Inlined X Y" counts in TraceCompilation output directly correspond to the sum of Inlined states in TraceInlining. When investigating compilation time issues, TraceCompilation identifies slow compilations while TraceInlining reveals whether excessive inlining exploration caused the slowdown.

**With --engine.TracePerformanceWarnings=call**, you identify gaps between what should inline and what actually did. Performance warnings flag virtual calls remaining in compiled code—calls that should have specialized and inlined but didn't. Cross-referencing warnings with TraceInlining reveals whether budget limits, size constraints, or indirect calls prevented optimization. This combination is essential for achieving peak performance.

**With IGV (Ideal Graph Visualizer)** using `--vm.Djdk.graal.Dump=Truffle:1 --vm.Djdk.graal.PrintGraph=Network`, you gain visual representation of the call tree and IR graphs. TraceInlining provides the text-based decision log, while IGV shows the resulting compiled code structure. Visual graphs reveal patterns difficult to spot in text traces: excessive control flow merging, unexplained IR bloat, or missed optimization opportunities. The tools complement each other—text for quick analysis, visual for deep investigation.

**With --engine.TraceSplitting**, you understand the interaction between polymorphism and inlining. Call target splitting (monomorphization) duplicates compilation profiles for polymorphic call sites, enabling better type specialization. TraceInlining shows inlining decisions for split targets (marked with `<split-ID>` in function names), while TraceSplitting shows why splitting occurred. Together they reveal whether splitting successfully enabled better inlining or just created duplicate compilation units without benefit.

## 6. Additional Notes
### Overhead

The performance overhead of TraceInlining is minimal, affecting only compilation time, not runtime performance. Enabling the trace adds approximately 1% to compilation time for the string formatting and output generation. Since compilation occurs asynchronously in background threads by default, this overhead is typically invisible to application execution. The trace has **zero runtime performance impact**—inlining decisions are identical whether tracing is enabled or disabled. Memory overhead is negligible, limited to buffering output strings.

Production use is generally not recommended despite low overhead. The tool generates substantial output volume—potentially thousands of lines for large applications or long-running services compiling many functions. Log management systems can struggle with this volume, and the output provides no operational value in production. The appropriate usage model is development and testing environments where performance diagnosis occurs, then disabling for production deployment. If production issues require inlining analysis, enable the tool temporarily in controlled debugging scenarios with output redirected to files for offline analysis.
### Limitations

The tool has several limitations worth noting. Output volume can be overwhelming for large applications—a single compilation might generate hundreds of trace lines, and applications might perform thousands of compilations. No built-in filtering mechanism exists to focus on specific functions; developers must use external tools like grep or redirect output and analyze offline. Output appears only when compilations complete, not progressively, so long-running compilations appear silent until finishing. No aggregation across multiple compilations of the same function occurs—each compilation produces independent traces, even though multi-tier compilation means functions compile multiple times. 

### Best Practice 

Best practices for effective use of TraceInlining include starting with simple, small test programs to understand the output format before analyzing complex production code. Always combine with `--engine.TraceCompilation` to provide context—knowing when and at what tier a function compiled helps interpret its inlining decisions. Focus analysis on hot path functions identified through profiling (`--cpusampler`) rather than trying to optimize every function's inlining. Use `--engine.CompileOnly=functionName` to restrict compilation to specific functions during debugging, dramatically reducing output volume. Redirect output to files (`js --engine.TraceInlining=true script.js > trace.txt 2>&1`) for offline analysis with text processing tools. Monitor IR node counts relative to budgets—functions approaching 12,000 nodes risk exhausting inlining budget. Check call diff values to understand whether inlining eliminates or adds call overhead.
### Common mistakes

Common mistakes include misinterpreting Cutoff as failure when it's often normal and acceptable for unimportant functions. Not every call should inline—the compiler makes deliberate trade-offs to focus budget on the most important calls. Another pitfall is increasing budgets indiscriminately without measuring actual performance impact. Larger budgets cause longer compilation times, higher memory usage, and potential compilation failures from excessive complexity. Always increase conservatively (25-50% increments) and validate with benchmarks. Developers sometimes misinterpret positive call diff values as always indicating problems, but they can represent acceptable trade-offs if the exposed calls subsequently inline or enable other optimizations. Not correlating inlining traces with actual performance measurements is a critical mistake—inlining decisions should optimize for real performance, not theoretical metrics. Finally, forgetting multi-tier compilation means analyzing only first-tier traces without examining second-tier compilations that apply full optimization.
### Related Tools

Related tools provide complementary inlining analysis capabilities. The `--engine.TraceInliningDetails` flag expands the trace to show the entire explored call tree, including all candidates considered for inlining, not just those actually inlined or expanded. This reveals the complete decision space but generates much more output. The `--engine.TraceMethodExpansion=truffleTier` and `--engine.TraceNodeExpansion=truffleTier` options trace host Java method and Truffle node expansion during partial evaluation, showing where IR nodes come from and revealing code bloat sources. These are more detailed than TraceInlining, useful for understanding why specific functions generate so many IR nodes. IGV (Ideal Graph Visualizer) provides visual call graphs and IR graphs, offering intuitive understanding of inlining decisions and their results. The `--engine.CompilationStatistics` option gives aggregate inlining metrics across all compilations, quantifying overall inlining success rates and budget consumption patterns.

description: Analyzes Truffle language implementations to generate testable performance theories. Loads benchmark baselines, performs systematic code analysis, and produces prioritized hypotheses with verification plans. Use after establishing baseline to identify potential performance issues before profiling. Use when analyzing why code is slow, finding optimization opportunities, or planning performance investigation. (project)

# Generating Performance Theories

Systematically analyzes language implementation code to generate testable performance hypotheses. Produces a prioritized list of theories ready for verification with profiling tools.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Loads benchmark data** - Reads BENCHMARK_BASELINE.md and timing results
2. **Analyzes performance gaps** - Compares actual vs expected performance
3. **Performs systematic code analysis** - Examines implementation for anti-patterns
4. **Generates prioritized theories** - Each with verification plan and expected evidence
5. **Outputs theory list** - Ready for `verifying-performance-theories` skill

## Prerequisites

- **REQUIRED**: `BENCHMARK_BASELINE.md` exists (from `establishing-benchmark-baseline` skill)
- **REQUIRED**: Benchmark timing data available
- **RECOMMENDED**: Familiarity with Truffle/Graal performance patterns

## Quick Start

**Step 1**: Ask user for analysis focus using AskUserQuestion:
- All issues (comprehensive)
- Critical & high-impact only
- Implementation issues only
- Configuration issues only
- Architectural issues only

**Step 2**: Load benchmark baseline and timing results

**Step 3**: Execute systematic analysis following [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md)

**Step 4**: Output theory list for verification

## Theory Structure

Each generated theory includes:

```
Theory: [Description of the performance issue]
Source: [Where discovered - code location, performance gap, pattern]
Category: [Implementation / Configuration / Architectural]
Severity: [Critical / High / Medium / Low]
Verification Tools:
  - Tool 1: [skill name] → Purpose: [what to check]
  - Tool 2: [skill name] → Purpose: [what to check]
Expected Evidence: [What tool output would confirm theory]
Rationale: [Why this is expected to be an issue]
```

## Analysis Categories

### Implementation Issues
- Missing specializations in operations/nodes
- Uncached method calls or library usage
- Improper boundary annotations
- Frame access patterns causing materialization

**Tool Skills for Verification**:
- `detecting-performance-warnings` - Find optimization barriers
- `profiling-with-cpu-sampler` - Identify hot functions
- `tracing-execution-counts` - Verify frequencies

### Configuration Issues
- Bytecode DSL settings
- Compilation thresholds
- Boxing elimination configuration
- Missing optimization flags

**Tool Skills for Verification**:
- `tracing-compilation-events` - Check compilation behavior
- `analyzing-compiler-graphs` - Examine IR optimizations

### Architectural Issues
- Data structure choices causing allocation
- Object shape instability
- Recursive patterns without proper caching
- Control flow preventing optimization

**Tool Skills for Verification**:
- `profiling-memory-allocations` - Track allocation patterns
- `detecting-deoptimizations` - Find instabilities
- `analyzing-compiler-graphs` - Deep IR analysis

## Systematic Code Analysis

### Step 1: Language Definition & Bytecode Configuration
```
Check @GenerateBytecode annotation settings:
- [ ] Boxing elimination enabled for primitives?
- [ ] Uncached interpreter enabled?
- [ ] Appropriate tier thresholds?
```

### Step 2: ALL Operations/Nodes
```
For EACH @Operation or Node class:
- [ ] Has primitive specializations (int, long, double)?
- [ ] Uses @Cached for method lookups?
- [ ] Proper @TruffleBoundary on slow paths?
- [ ] No virtual calls in hot paths?
```

### Step 3: Runtime Data Structures
```
For each runtime type (Object, Array, Class, Function):
- [ ] Shape stability maintained?
- [ ] Inline caching for property access?
- [ ] Efficient storage (primitives not boxed)?
```

### Step 4: Frame and Variable Access
```
- [ ] Slot access uses FrameSlotKind properly?
- [ ] No unnecessary materialization?
- [ ] Stable frame sizes?
```

### Step 5: Library and Interop Usage
```
- [ ] All @CachedLibrary has limit parameter?
- [ ] @ExportLibrary on appropriate classes?
- [ ] Interop calls cached?
```

## Priority Levels

- **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Blocks optimization entirely (missing @Cached, virtual calls in hot paths)
- **Priority 2 (High)**: Significant degradation (missing specializations, boxing overhead)
- **Priority 3 (Medium)**: Noticeable impact (suboptimal caching limits, allocation patterns)
- **Priority 4 (Low)**: Minor optimizations (code style, minor inefficiencies)

## Output Format

```markdown
# Performance Theories

Generated: [Date]
Focus: [User-selected focus]
Benchmark: [Benchmark name]

## Theory 1: [Title]

**Source**: [code location or performance gap]
**Category**: Implementation
**Severity**: Critical

**Verification Plan**:
1. `detecting-performance-warnings` → Check for virtual call warnings at [location]
2. `profiling-with-cpu-sampler` → Measure time in [function], expect >X% if theory true

**Expected Evidence**: Virtual call warning at line X, or >30% time in interpreter tier

**Rationale**: [Why this is expected to cause issues]

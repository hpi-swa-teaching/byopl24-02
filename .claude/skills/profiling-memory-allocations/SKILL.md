# Profiling Memory Allocations

Experimental allocation profiler tracking memory allocations at the guest-language level. Identifies allocation-heavy locations and unnecessary object creation.

## When to Use This Skill

- Identify allocation-heavy locations in hot loops
- Find unnecessary object creation
- Understand memory behavior patterns
- Detect escape analysis opportunities

**Note**: High allocations in hot loops = optimization opportunity if escape analysis isn't eliminating them.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic memory tracing
<launcher> --memtracer <program>

# With stack traces
<launcher> --memtracer --memtracer.TraceStackTraces=true <program>

# Filter by allocation count
<launcher> --memtracer --memtracer.TraceMem=1000 <program>
```

## ⚠️ REQUIRED: Fermi Verification (Every Tool Invocation)

**Before running**:
- [ ] Pre-calculate: Expected allocation count (estimate based on loops/iterations)
- [ ] Smoke test: `<launcher> --memtracer -c 'var a = 👉1, 2, 3👈;'` → Verify shows allocations

**After running**:
- [ ] Validate: Actual vs estimate within 1 order of magnitude? YES / NO
- [ ] If NO: **STOP** - Debug tool before proceeding (test with known allocating code)
- [ ] Save output: `tool-outputs/memtracer-[benchmark].txt`

**Gate**: All boxes checked? → Proceed to analysis

## Key Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--memtracer` | Enable memory tracer |
| `--memtracer.TraceStackTraces=true` | Include allocation stack traces |
| `--memtracer.TraceMem=<bytes>` | Filter by minimum allocation |
| `--memtracer.Output=json` | JSON output format |
| `--memtracer.OutputFile=<file>` | Save to file |

## Understanding Output

### Sample Output

```
Memory Tracer. Recorded 45678 allocations.

Source Location           || Count   || Size      || Type
queens.lox:42            || 50000   || 400KB     || LoxArray
queens.lox:55            || 25000   || 200KB     || LoxObject
```

## Interpretation

### Allocation Patterns

| Pattern | Status | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Few allocations in hot path | ✅ Good | Escape analysis working |
| Many allocations in hot loop | ⚠️ Problem | Objects escaping |
| Allocations only in cold path | ✅ OK | Expected behavior |

### High Allocation Sites

If hot loop shows many allocations:
1. Check if objects escape the loop
2. Verify escape analysis is running
3. Consider restructuring to avoid allocation

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Array Allocations in Loop

```
queens.lox:42  || 50000 allocations
```

**Cause**: Creating arrays inside hot loop
**Fix**: Reuse arrays, or ensure they're eliminated by EA

### Issue 2: Object Allocations for Temporaries

```
Point creation || 100000 allocations
```

**Cause**: Temporary objects not eliminated
**Fix**: Keep objects local, avoid escaping references
